We, the contributors of Recon MindMap (RMM), are dedicated to creating a welcoming and inclusive community. We value the participation of every member of our community and want everyone to feel safe and respected.

As contributors and maintainers of this project, we pledge to respect all people who contribute through reporting issues, submitting feature requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests, and other activities.

We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, sexual identity and orientation, or any other characteristic.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery
- Personal attacks
- Trolling or insulting/derogatory comments
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission
- Other unethical or unprofessional conduct

We will not tolerate unacceptable behavior from any community member, including project maintainers. Anyone who violates this Code of Conduct may be banned from the project and its communication channels.

If anyone is subject to or witnesses unacceptable behavior, please notify us by sending a message to [@alevsk](https://twitter.com/alevsk). All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
